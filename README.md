# Credit-Scoring-Model
---
The dataset contains data on loans for the purchase of electronics that have been approved.

Problem statement:
- [x] The goal of this competition is necessary to classify clients into those who will not open a credit account, and those who will open one.

We will be using a random forest classifier for reasons: because it would allow us to quickly and easily change the output to a simple binary classification problem. Secondly, because the predict_proba functionality allows us to output a probability score.

### Outcome

This model lead to an accuracy rate of 0.825212

I deem this accuracy rate to be acceptable given that we used a relatively simple based approach
